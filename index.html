      <p>The locations on this map are 5 of the most significant locations in my life. The locations are my college, Molloy, my job, Beach Bum, my high school, Plainedge High School, my old dance studio, Kj Dance Theatre, and my home. These places are significant to me because they all hold memories in my heart and these are all the places where I grew up and experienced many highs and lows, and I developed as a person. I also learned a great deal from everyone at each of these locations. I feel as if you can tell a lot about a person and their personalities by their favorite places. I feel like I am an open book and I can easily tell anyone my opinions about anything. Hopefully by reading my descriptions of each location and why they are important to me, people will be able to figure me out.</p>
